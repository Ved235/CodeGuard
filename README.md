  ## Introducing CodeGuard - The open-source tool to obfuscate your JavaScript or Python code

  ## How I got this inspiration?

  **Once upon a time**, I was creating an **project which does really great thing including making meetings, etc.** and this idea came in my mind:

  ***Why would I allow someone steal my code pretending that he wrote that script/code?***

  So, I though why don't I make a code obfuscator to make my code hard to read and nearly impossible to understand? So, that's the beginning of **[CodeGuard](https://codeguard.tech)**.

  ## How did I make it? (Project workflow)

  **Once a user provides a link to the file, we recommend using [*GitHub Gist*](https://gist.github.com) because the project was made to be used with Gist, but it will work also if you give a direct link to the file like `https://example.com/myproject/main.py`**

  **The user will be selecting either Python or JavaScript:**

  Upon the user selection, it will call the API located in `api.codeguard.tech` providing 2 parameters, the code link in `link` and the programming language in `lang`, of course you would like to try to use the **API** yourself, we will leave a guide below!

  As soon as the **API has been called**, it will start getting the file and obfuscating it, as soon as the **obfuscated file is ready, it will be automatically downloaded at the user side**.

  As update 1.1, now the API only needs 1 required parameter (`link`) and one additional optional parameter (`redirect`), check the article linked below to stay up-to-date!

  ## The tech-stack I used + Why did I use it?

  - **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)** - *Making the front-end design of the website*

  - **HTML/CSS** - *Making front-end*

  - **[JavaScript](https://javascript.com)** - *Back-end, for e.g. modal (alert) and link validation*

  - **[Linux](https://linux.org) [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com) ([Linode](https://linode.com))** - *Host the API*

  - **[Vercel](https://vercel.com)** - *Host the website*

  - **[Python](https://python.org) ([Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/))** - *Used to make the API*

  ## API

  ### Use the API (hosted by us)

  It's really simple to use our API, in JavaScript, it only requires one line of code!

  ```js
  window.location = "https://api.codeguard.tech/?link=<code link here>
  ```

  For example:

  ```js
  window.location = "https://api.codeguard.tech/?link=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Omar8345/1038a82e7db5f81d0722a4f2ab701924/raw/b213490f419b1d67de6a6a1647557934b97fc1ef/nicecode.js
  ```

  ### Hosting the API on your machine

  - Clone the repository on your local machine:

  `git clone https://github.com/Omar8345/CodeGuard`

  Next, head into `CodeGuard/API` and open your favorite IDE, if you use **Visual Studio Code**, just enter:

  `code .`

  - And it will open up **VSC** in the folder, just run in the terminal the following command:

  `$env:FLASK_APP="__init__.py" && flask run`

  - You should see a local link, head into it or [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/) and you should find some kind of error, just simply ignore it, now add the `link` parameter value and you should be good to go!
